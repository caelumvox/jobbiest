        <h1>about</h1>
        <p>jobbiest was developed by someone who was interested in creating a better experience for others who are looking for a place to work. There weren't any real resources on the internet to track and analyze a job seeker's progress towards their next big opportunity, so this site was created to provide all the tools to track, annotate, and log entries in an effort to make the selection process on that next job perfect.</p>
